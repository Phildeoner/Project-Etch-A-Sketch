-Create a webpage with a 16x16 grid of square divs
-Create the divs using JavaScript. Don’t try making them by hand with copy and pasting in your HTML file!
-It’s best to put your grid squares inside another “container” div (which can go directly in your HTML).
-There are several different ways to make the divs appear as a grid (versus just one on each line).
-Set up a “hover” effect so that the grid divs change color when your mouse passes over them, leaving a (pixelated) trail through your grid like a pen would.
-Add a button to the top of the screen that will send the user a popup asking for the number of squares per side for the new grid.
-Push your project to GitHub!
